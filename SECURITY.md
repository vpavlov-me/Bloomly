## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability:

1. Do **not** open a public issue.
2. Email babytrack@vibecoding.com with a detailed report.
3. Include reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behavior, and impact assessment.
4. Encrypt the message if needed (PGP key — TODO).

We will acknowledge your report within two business days and share next steps. Once the fix is ready, we will coordinate a disclosure date with the reporter.
